Development
===========

== The Source Code

The code is stored inside a git tree which contains all branches and releases.

All repositories can be browsed online through
http://github.com/libremesh/[GitHub] as well.

== Getting The _LiMe_ Code

Any _LiMe_ development happens in the main git repository which is
accessible via HTTPS:

----
git clone https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages.git
----

== The Web Presence

The pages you're reading are generated from text files using the
http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] suite plus jekyll. Any changes made to the
projects web site will be reflected in our web git repository:

In order to generate these docs locally:
----
git clone https://github.com/libremesh/lime-web.git
cd lime-web && bundler install
jekyll serve
----
For more details, check the README on Github.

== Submitting Patches

We accept pull requests via GitHub. But patches can also be submitted via the dev mailing list.
