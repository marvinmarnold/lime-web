== Download Precompiled Binaries

We offer a list of precompiled **generic** firmware images. This is the easiest way to first test and install LiMe in your router.

* The current **stable tested release** is Community Chaos, images can be found at http://downloads.libremesh.org/community_chaos[downloads] site (the bigger the revision number the newer the release).

* For more targets and LiMe versions you can use the automatic generated, not tested, images from http://builds.libremesh.org/develop[Lime-Build develop].


== Use the Chef Application (recommended)

Chef is our own web application for generating customized firmware images.

https://chef.altermundi.net[Chef homepage.]

== Compile Using the Tool lime-build

_lime-build_ is a tool to easily compile locally a firmware image. It also creates a development environment.
It consists in a Makefile file, so it is executed using the GNU "make" command.

Install build dependencies, for example on a Debian/Ubuntu based Linux distribution install the following packages (using a graphical software manager or apt-get):

----
sudo apt-get install subversion zlib1g-dev gawk flex unzip bzip2 gettext build-essential libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev binutils cpp psmisc docbook-to-man
----

Clone lime-build git repository
----
git clone https://github.com/libremesh/lime-build.git
cd lime-build
----

You can see the list of officially supported targets (supported hardware, refer to https://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start[OpenWrt Table of Hardware]) and profiles (sets of LibreMesh packages) by typing:
----
make info
----

To compile a target/profile just execute (example):
----
make T=ar71xx P=generic
----

[NOTE]
================
* T is the target related to the hardware type.

* P is the profile related to the software combination of packets.

* A successful build is dependent on a stable network connection. Poor network connections seem to be exacerbated by compiling using multiple cores. If build fails simply try again or use the option `J=1` if you don't mind waiting longer.
================

You will find the binaries ready to install in _output_ directory.

See the https://github.com/libremesh/lime-build/blob/develop/README.md[lime-build README] for more information and options.

== Compile the Code Using Pristine OpenWrt buildroot

Refer to https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages[lime-packages README].
