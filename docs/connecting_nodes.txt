Connecting to LiMe nodes
========================

== Connecting to your own node

Usually you can use DHCP to get an IP configuration for your computer when attached via WiFi or Ethernet.
The IP for the node where you are attached to, will be the default gateway for your computer (ip route)
You can also use the special domain names **anygw** or **thisnode.info**.


You can access the node by opening your browser and going to http://anygw[http://anygw] or http://thisnode.info[thisnode.info]. Doing so will give you access to the administration GUI called LuCI. Like most things you will encounter, LuCI is not unique to LiME. It is a common configuration interface for https://github.com/openwrt/luci[OpenWRT].

First time you can also use TELNET (`telnet anygw`) and when password is set SSH (`ssh root@IP_ADDRESS`).

Default username is root with no password.


== Connect using ipv6 link-local

Each working network interface in your Linux system have a special IPv6 address configured automatically by the Kernel.
These are named IPv6 link-local and are inside the special prefix fe80::/10
The scope of these IPs is to communicate computers which are in the same colision domain, so translated to LiMe it would be the layer2 Cloud.


But, how to know the IPv6 link-local address of the host we want to achieve?
Using ICMPv6 we can discover machines in our network thanks to the special Multicast address "ff02::".
to discover routers (group 2) we can use the next command:

----
ping6 ff02::2%eth0
----

Then each router connected to our colision domain, will reply the ICMP request with its own IPv6 link-local address.

----
p4u@nomada:~$ $ ping6 ff02::2%eth1 -c2
PING ff02::2%eth1(ff02::2) 56 data bytes
64 bytes from fe80::a2f3:c1ff:fe39:1cea: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.956 ms
64 bytes from fe80::a2f3:c1ff:fe39:1cea: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.949 ms
----

We can connect to it using ssh:

----
ssh root@fe80::a2f3:c1ff:fe39:1cea%eth1
----

Or copy files using scp:

----
scp LiMe-fw.bin root@\[fe80::a2f3:c1ff:fe39:1cea%eth1\]:/tmp/
----

This is a small script which check if there is some router attached to your network device and in case, try to connect to it.
If there are not routers it waits until some appears.

[source,bash]
.disc6
----
#!/bin/bash
INT=${1:-eth0}
MYIP="$(ip addr show dev $INT | grep -e "inet6.*scope link" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1)"
NEIGH="$(ping6 ff02::2%$INT -n -c3 2>/dev/null | grep fe80 2>/dev/null | awk '{print $4}' | sed 's/\(.*\)./\1/' | sort -u)"
RNEIGH="$(echo -e "$NEIGH" | grep -v $MYIP | grep -v "^$" | sort -u)"
if [ $(echo -e "$RNEIGH" | wc -l) -eq 1 -a $(echo -e "$RNEIGH" | wc -c) -gt 4 ]; then
    echo "Host found, connecting to it!"
    telnet $RNEIGH%$INT || ssh root@$RNEIGH%$INT
elif [ -z "$RNEIGH" ]; then
    echo -n "."
    exec $0 $@
else
    echo "Several Hosts found:"
    echo -e "$RNEIGH"
fi
----

An example of execution:

----
p4u@nomada:~$ $ disc6 eth1
...........................Host found, connecting to it!

Warning: Permanently added 'fe80::a2f3:c1ff:fe39:7cea%eth1' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
root@fe80::a2f3:c1ff:fe39:7cea%eth1's password:

== Connecting to other nodes

Using the IPv4 or the IPv6 you should be able to connect to any node.
It should appear in the menu BMX6 -> Nodes -> (click on the blue circle).

All the nodes are probably in the same collision domain, so you can use NMAP to discover the nodes in your network and their IPv4s.

pass:[<code>nmap -sT -p 80 10.X.Y.0/24 --open</code>]

**You can also use the IPv6 link-local address to connect with the nodes of your layer2 Cloud.**
