== Troubleshooting

=== Recover from bad flashes with Failsafe mode
Failsafe mode enables you to recover from bad flashes without much trouble. Learn how to access Failsafe mode  http://wiki.villagetelco.org/OpenWrt_Failsafe_Mode_and_Flash_Recovery[here].

Once in failsafe, try to connect. If that does not work, you may need to deactivate DHCP. On Ubuntu:

. Open Network Connections (right click network icon -> edit connections)
. Edit your Ethernet connection
. Under IPv4 settings, set method to manual
. Add a new entry with
.. Address = 192.168.1.1
.. Netmask = 24
.. Gateway = blank
.. Do not change any other fields, save and continue
. The connection should not succeed. From the terminal, execute `telnet 192.168.1.1`

=== Unable to establish Ethernet connection
As an alternative to failsafe, you may create a custom profile to connect over Ethernet.

Create profile:

. Edit connections -> Add -> Select `Ethernet`
. Give it any name you desire, such as `eth0 libre`
. General tab: deselect `Automatic connect`
. IPv4 tab: select `Disabled`
. IPv6 tab: select `Link-Local only`

Determine router's IPv6 router direction:

. Turn on your router. Using an Ethernet cable, connect your PC to LAN port. WAN should also work.
. Select the new `eth0 libre` connection from the network manager applet.
. Open a terminal. Execute `ifconfig` to get the name of the Ethernet interface. It is probably something like `eth0` or `enp3s0`. We will assume `eth0` for the rest of this guide.
. Execute `ping6 ff02::1%eth0`.
. When the router is ready, each ping should receive a response. The first will be from your own PC and the next (maked as `DUP`) should be your router.
. The router direction is a combination of the router's IPv6 address, `%`, and your Ethernet interface name. It should be something like `fe90::aa20:66ff:fe4f:ae87%eth0`. Do not include a trailing `:` or other text from the ping responses.

Connect with IPv6: Using example router direction above.

. Telnet: `telnet fe90::aa20:66ff:fe4f:ae87%eth0`. If the answer is `Connection refused`, try SSH.
. SSH: `ssh root@fe90::aa20:66ff:fe4f:ae87%eth0`. Remember to include `root@`, otherwise it will attempt to connect using your personal username. The default password is blank. If that doesn't work, try the last password you remember.
. If that does not work, try the IPv4 instructions below. Although that is unlikely to work either.

Connect with IPv4:

. Execute `dhclient -v eth0` as root, eg `sudo dhclient -v eth0`. This only works using the router's LAN port.
. Open `http://thisnode.info` in your browser.
